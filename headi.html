    <h1>The Minimalist Web: Crafting Pages with Only the Basics</h1>
    <h5>By Alex Parker | Published: August 15, 2025</h5>
    <p>In a world where websites are loaded with flashy animations, heavy scripts, and high-resolution images, the art of building a pure, lightweight webpage is nearly forgotten. This article explores the charm and power of HTML’s <mark>simplest tags.</mark></p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Back-to-Basics Movement</h2>
    <p >Back in the early days of the internet, webpages were <span style="color: aquamarine;">nothing more than</span> plain text, sprinkled with bold and italic styles. The focus was on the content, not the decoration. In many ways, this was the golden age of readability.
      The HTML language itself was designed for structure — headings, paragraphs, and semantic meaning. E = mc<sup>2</sup> still looks good without a single pixel of CSS, and H<sub>2</sub>O remains as clear as ever.</p>

    <h2>Why Strip It Down?</h2>
    <p>There’s a quiet beauty in simplicity. Without distractions, readers focus on the words. Minimalism is not the lack of something, it’s the perfect amount of something, as a famous designer once said.
      Removing images and heavy layouts means faster load times, better accessibility, and even nostalgia for the <strike>chaotic</strike> <u>simpler</u> internet days.</p>

    <H2>Magazine-Style Sections</H2>
    <P>Just like in a printed magazine, articles can be divided with <B><U>bold headings</U></B> and subtle separators. Think of  as the thin line between chapters, and headings as your section titles.
      You can even keep a “side note” feel with smaller text for author comments or additional reading hints.</P>

    <h2>A Practical Demonstration</h2>
    <p><pre><b>Imagine we are describing a recipe in this minimal style:

Step 1: Mix 250g of flour with H2O until smooth. Step 2: Heat at 180°C for 30 minutes. Step 3: <strike>Serve cold</strike> <u>Serve warm</u> for best taste.

Code snippet: temperature = 180; // degrees Celsius</b></pre></p>
